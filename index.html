<div><h2>A funny story</h2>
<p>
    A couple of years ago while I was on holiday in Sardinia we decided to rent bikes to explore the surroundings of the island.<br>
    We went to a calm cliff to have a nice view over the Mediterranean Sea, chill a bit and take some nice pictures.<br>
    After a while we went back to get our bikes which were locked to a fence in a quite secluded area and to my astonishment,<br>
    my saddle had disappeared. Apparently somebody had been in the neighborhood who was in dire need for a new saddle.<br>
    After the initial surprise and looking around for it, there was nothing left to do but ride back to the rental place standing up<br>
    on the pedals in the boiling sun. It was quite a distance, but we still managed to make it in time to return our bikes and explain<br>
    what had happened. Afterwards we had some nice cocktails and had a good laugh about the absurdity of the situation. <br>To this day
    it is still a mystery who the hell that saddle and why.
</p>
<h3>TL;DR: The saddle of my rented bike got stolen while looking at the Mediterranean Sea <br>on a desolate cliff in Cagliari, Sardina
    so I had to ride my way back standing on the pedals <br>in the boiling heat.</h3>
